# IMDb Watchlist Manager v2

Automating the rating and deletion of movies from the IMDb watchlist.

## Changes

The app is now executable.

A demo WATCHLIST.csv is included, but you should download your own so it can work properly with your account.

#### Run the app via IMDb Watchlist Manager

## Requirements
#### Packages:

```selenium```

#### Webdriver:

Download Chrome webdriver from [this link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

Or download Mozilla Geckodriver from [this link](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

Then place the downloaded file inside your Python Scripts folder (e.g. C:\Python\Python37\Scripts)

Make sure to add "Scripts" folder to ```PATH``` so it can load properly

## Usage

You should download your own WATCHLIST.csv file from your IMDb account (for now**):
* Login to your account
* Go to Watchlist
* Scroll all the way down and click ```Export this list```
* Put the downloaded file inside the program directory

** In the next versions this would not be needed.
